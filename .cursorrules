# Cursor Rules for Musical Rental Inventory Project

# Python Environment Management
- Always source the virtual environment before installing packages:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- Never install pip packages globally or without activating venv first
- Add new dependencies to requirements.txt after installing

# Make Commands
- Use Make commands for common development tasks
- Add new targets to Makefile for repeatable operations
- Common targets should include:
  - `make install` - Install dependencies
  - `make migrate` - Run database migrations
  - `make test` - Run test suite
  - `make lint` - Run linting
- When adding new development workflows, create corresponding Make targets

# Testing Requirements
- All model changes MUST have accompanying unit tests
- Unit tests should cover:
  - Model creation with valid data
  - String representation (__str__ method)
  - Model-specific methods and properties
  - Validation rules and constraints
  - Relationships with other models
  - Field constraints and validations
- Place model tests in tests/unit/test_models.py
- Run tests before committing changes: `make test-unit`

# Best Practices
- Document new Make targets in README.md
- Keep Makefile targets focused and composable
- Use .env for environment variables, never hardcode
- Run tests before committing changes
- Follow Django's model best practices:
  - Add docstrings to models and methods
  - Use appropriate field types
  - Implement proper validation
  - Define clear relationships
